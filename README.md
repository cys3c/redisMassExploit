# redisMassExploit
Some handy script to collect hosts installed redis (using Shodan search engine) and exploit them
##How to use
Using shodanCollector first to get a list of hosts install redis (can collect more than 2000 IP at my execution time).
(I remove most of the hosts in this repo due to security concern)

Copy the archieved IP list to the "targets" file (in proper format) and run massAttack!!!
